# Titanic-prediction-in-python
In this project I am going to use some classification such as logistic regression, KNN and Discriminant analysis to predict it.

The train.csv and python file are added. please open it in spyder or jupyter notebook or other editors.
some classification such as Logistic regression, Knn, discriminant analysis are applied and there are some visualizationof features.
It is not complete and there are some other classification which should be applied to find the best classification and have accurate prediction.
