# Titanic-prediction-in-python
In this project, I am going to use some classifications such as logistic regression, KNN, and Discriminant Analysis.

The train.csv and python files are added. please open it in spyder or Jupiter notebook or other editors. some classifications such as Logistic regression, Knn, and discriminant analysis are applied and there are some visualizations of features. It is not completed yet and there are some other classifications that should be applied to find the best one which has the best accuracy.
